```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ezknitr)
ezknit(file = "02_ezknitr.Rmd", out_dir = "docs", fig_dir = "myfigs")
```

## trying ezknitr

This tries ezkniter, but there are errors.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
