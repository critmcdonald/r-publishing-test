## Using a markdown::render function

Found as the [second answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26174565/r-in-rstudio-how-do-i-make-knitr-output-to-a-different-folder-to-avoid-clutteri).

## Result

This seems to work. It understands images paths and bears further study.

It should [publish here](https://critmcdonald.github.io/r-publishing-test/04_knitropt.html)

## Image

Which is actually from `/images` in the project root, so this is huge.

![snowman](images/snowman.png){width=200px}

## plot

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
