Two suggestions from News Nerdery by `@abtran` and `@sharon.machlis`.

From Sharon

```r
library(magrittr) # for the pipe, unless you already have dplyr loaded
hw_folder_of_rmd_files <- "rmd_folder"

glue::glue("{hw_folder_of_rmd_files}/{list.files(hw_folder_of_rmd_files)}") %>%
purrr::walk(rmarkdown::render, output_dir = "docs", output_format = "html_document")
```

From Andrew

```r
hw_folder_of_rmd_files <- “rmd_folder”

list_of_files <- list.files(hw_folder_of_rmd_files)

for (i in 1:length(list_of_files)) {

 file_name <- paste0(hw_folder_of_rmd_files, “/”, list_of_files[i])
 rmarkdown::render(file_name, output_dir=“docs”, output_format=“html_document”)

}
```
